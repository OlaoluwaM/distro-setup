# Manual Setup Instructions

Now that all the automatic stuff are done here is what we need to do manually (in no particular order)

1. Restore dconf settings from backup
2. Restore gnome extensions
3. Restore user-specific cron jobs
4. Restore deja dup backup
5. Install & setup spicetify
6. Sign in to necessary accounts and pull down extensions (synced to google account)
7. Install and setup postgres with pgAdmin **(optional)**

If you need to reference this again, just cat this file
