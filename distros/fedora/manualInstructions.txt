Now that all the automatic stuff are done here is what we need to do manually (in no particular order)

1. unzip all your wallpapers from the tar folder
2. Setup git lfs
3. Install icon theme library (McMojave-cursors from the pling store)
4. Restore backup files from google drive (documents, fonts, etc)
5. Install Cascadia code font from github (https://github.com/microsoft/cascadia-code) and import other fonts from google drive
6. Install and setup postgres with pgAdmin
7. Install protonvpn through its rpm https://protonvpn.com/support/official-linux-vpn-fedora/
8. Customize Gnome. Run ./install.sh -c dark -i fedora -N glassy. For gdm sudo ./tweaks.sh -F -s -g in ~/customizations/WhiteSur-gtk-theme dir
9. Install Element
10. Sign in to necessary accounts and pull down extensions (synced to google account)

Once all these are done you can run the dconfLoad.sh script
