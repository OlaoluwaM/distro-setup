Now that all the automatic stuff are done here is what we need to do manually (in no particular order)

1. Restore deja dup backup
2. Install & setup spicetify
3. Sign in to necessary accounts and pull down extensions (synced to google account)
4. Install and setup postgres with pgAdmin **(optional)**

Once all these are done you can run the dconfLoad.sh script

If you need to reference this again, just cat this file
